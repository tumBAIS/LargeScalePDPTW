## Solutions of the computational studies

`MATH/` contains all solutions of the sequential approach (Matching + Dispatching; MATH)

`ILS/` contains all solution for the decomposition-based metaheuristic approach (ILS)

`COMB/` contains all solution for ILS, warm-started with the solution of MATH (COMB)

### Tuning

`MATH_tuning/` contains the solutions of the tuning process for the MATH approach.

`ILS_tuning/` contains the solutions of the tuning process for the ILS approach.
