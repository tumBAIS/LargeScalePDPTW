## Solutions

We provide detailed solutions for computational studies. 

`case_study/` contains all solutions regarding the main case study of NYC

`computational_study/` contains all solution concerning the comparison of the three proposed approach: Sequential Matching and Dispatching (MATH); Decomposition-based metaheuristic approach (ILS); ILS warm-started with the solutions from MATH

`pdptw/` contains all solutions found during our final run of experiments for the reference benchmark of [Sartori&Buriol](https://github.com/cssartori/pdptw-instances).

### Tuning

`MATH_tuning/` contains the solutions of the tuning process for the MATH approach.

`ILS_tuning/` contains the solutions of the tuning process for the ILS approach.
